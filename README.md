# 🗳️ VoteVerse  
### Decentralized Campus Election System (Algorand Powered)

VoteVerse is a blockchain-based voting platform built on **Algorand TestNet** to bring transparency, trust, and tamper-proof elections to campus governance.

---

## 🚨 Problem

Campus elections today are:
- Centrally controlled  
- Non-verifiable  
- Vulnerable to manipulation  
- Lacking transparency  

Students cannot independently verify results.

---

## 💡 Solution

VoteVerse records every vote directly on the **Algorand blockchain**, making it:

- ✅ Immutable  
- ✅ Transparent  
- ✅ Wallet-authenticated  
- ✅ Publicly verifiable  

Each vote = Blockchain transaction.

No centralized database.  
No hidden result manipulation.
